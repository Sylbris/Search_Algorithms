# Search_Algorithms
This is a course in Ariel University that focus on all pathfinding algorithms, including A* , IDA, DFBNB

# Exercise
I have implemented a search engine, that supports multiple search algorithms.
The goal is to solve the board game "marble color shuffle".

# Game rules:

Your given an input board:

Goal board:

Then the input includes which search algorithm to use,
Wether to print the open list at each iteration.

each turn your allowed, to move one of the marbles in any empty slot,
your allowed to move left, right , up or down (if that slot is empty).
each moving of a marble has a cost depending its color.


Output:

The path to the goal state,
Cost to the goal state,
Number of nodes created.
